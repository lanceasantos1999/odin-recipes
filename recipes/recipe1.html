    <h2>Ratatouille is a French Provençal dish of stewed vegetables that originated in Nice and is sometimes referred to
        as ratatouille niçoise.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium sweet red pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh basil</li>
        <li>1/2 pound small zucchini, thinly sliced (about 3 cups)</li>
        <li>1/2 pound yellow summer squash, thinly sliced (about 3 cups)</li>
        <li>3/4 pound Chinese eggplant, thinly sliced (about 4 cups)</li>
        <li>6 plum tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh basil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Saute onion, garlic and red peppers</li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a large ovenproof skillet, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions,
            red peppers and garlic and cook and stir until tender, about four to five minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 2: Add tomatoes and basil</li>
        <p>Add the crushed tomatoes and basil to the vegetables. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Simmer,
            uncovered, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat.</p>
        <li>Step 3: Stack the vegetables</li>
        <p>On a flat surface, layer the sliced vegetables into stacks. Start with a zucchini slice, followed by a slice
            of yellow squash, then eggplant, and then tomato. Be sure to keep your stacks small. While it may be
            tempting to make really tall stacks to speed up the process, they’re more difficult to handle.</p>
        <li>Step 4: Arrange the vegetables in circles</li>
        <p>Move the stacks of sliced vegetables into the skillet, placing them on their sides around the outside edge of
            the skillet in a circular pattern. Continue adding stacks to make concentric circles until the skillet is
            full.</p>
        <li>Step 5: Add the herb topping</li>
        <p>In a small bowl, combine the topping ingredients, then brush the herb mixture generously over the vegetables.
        </p>
        <li>Step 6: Bake the ratatouille</li>
        <p>Cover the vegetables with a single layer of parchment paper and bake until the vegetables are almost tender,
            about 40 minutes. Remove the parchment paper and continue to bake until the vegetables are tender and the
            sauce is bubbling, about 15 to 20 minutes longer. Let stand for at least 10 minutes before serving.</p>
